    This class provides a framework to exclude fields for certain
    identifiers. Up to three arguments are passed to this class, an
    identifier list, a list of fields to remove, and minimum list
    size.  The identifier list is a list of document identifiers to act
    on.  The list of fields are fields that will be removed; they are
    specified using a dotstring notation.  The minimum list size is
    the minimum number of elements that should be in a list in order
    for it to be removed.  The 'drugbank', 'chebi', and 'ndc' data
    sources were manually tested with this class.
