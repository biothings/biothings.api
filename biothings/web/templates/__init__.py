"""
The "templates" folder stores HTML templates for native biothings
web handlers and is structured as a dummy module to facilitate location
resolution. Typically, ``biothings.web.templates.__path__[0]`` returns
a string representing the location of this folder on the file system.
This folder is intended to be used internally by the SDK developer.
